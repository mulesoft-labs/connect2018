The lantern features themselves are excellent then add on the USB hub and charging by sun, USB and a hand crank you have a lantern that is second to none. Cons: it seems the internal bettieries are not user replaceable or at least it is not document as user replaceable. The on board hanging hook/handle has slid out on me seems like there should be more tension to keep it in place. None of these Cons are crictal to me so I would buy this lantern again.",

The light Britney's is exceptional. On the camp table it will easily give nice light to the campsite. The light source is adjustable from 180 to 360 degrees. I have not used the USB port but just having it is a comfort, knowing I can charge my phone etc. The lantern is of really high quality. There other features I didn't not comment on, all are good.

I was worried about it after the 2nd day because it did not seem to charge the same as it did the 1st. We did use it heavier on this last 4 day event, Charging 2 smart phones, 1 iPad2, 1 lighthouse 250, and we ran 3 of the new Light-a-Life 350's on it for probably 1 hour making and eating dinner each night. It recharged to full the 1st night with my Nomad 20 and Nomad 7 in tandem. The 2nd day it recharged to 100% again, the third day it was better than 80% and the last day I did not bother as we had to pack up. It never dropped below 60% until the last day and we used it to beat the band. Admittedly I do want to step up to the Yeti 400 for something with more power on hand. But that's cause I am too Boy scout I want to bring something out there for 4 days and be able to not have to worry about solar if the weather is not good for solar. But I can't complain this power pack delivered and held up great.",

Viewed this item on many other sites and decided to purchase with HD because I could easily return it if needed. I've had the generator for almost a month. This generator is SO QUIET! So far I charged a lamp, I Pad and phone. There is nothing to do, it comes right out of the box ready to go. You may need to charge a little but mine arrived charged. It's compact, easy to move around and has many ports. At this point I am considering upgrading to the larger one but wanted to test this out before investing more money. I gave it four stars only because I've had it such a short time and I'm still testing it, but so far so good. Hurricane Sandy was a wake up call us. Please take a moment to look around, we have hurricanes, earthquakes, power outages etc. The times are changing make sure your family is prepared, spiritually, mentally, physically. If the grid goes down it will be nice to have power and the ability to keep in touch with your family.",

Lightweight and easy to handle, it is a very good light.",

The first set of batteries lasted for a year, the 8 d batteries in the base charge the NICADS in the four removable lanterns. When they no longer hold a charge it is telling you it is time to change the main batteries, but the lantern will continue to work for days after this! We were able to send one lantern with the boys in each tent, and recharge them the next day because you know they left the light on all night! he is now a boy scout and the lantern convinced out troop to go to LED lanterns from propane! make sure to push the grey release button removing and placing the lanterns in the main base. we now have two!

When I want to light up a campsite with 6 tents full of YMCA adventure guides, I pump up this lantern, light it, and hoist it 8 feet in the air. Then I can put away my 12v 8xD 2-bulb flourescent lamp. A gallon of Coleman white-gas (naptha) fuel has lasted us for 3 years of camping (about 12 campouts or 24 days/nights total - cooking and using this lantern.) This lamp gives enough light to throw a football or frisbee a decent distance (30 ft) at night. Best of all : EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE JEALOUS !!!",

I was worried about it after the 2nd day because it did not seem to charge the same as it did the 1st. We did use it heavier on this last 4 day event, Charging 2 smart phones, 1 iPad2, 1 lighthouse 250, and we ran 3 of the new Light-a-Life 350's on it for probably 1 hour making and eating dinner each night. It recharged to full the 1st night with my Nomad 20 and Nomad 7 in tandem. The 2nd day it recharged to 100% again, the third day it was better than 80% and the last day I did not bother as we had to pack up. It never dropped below 60% until the last day and we used it to beat the band. Admittedly I do want to step up to the Yeti 400 for something with more power on hand. But that's cause I am too Boy scout I want to bring something out there for 4 days and be able to not have to worry about solar if the weather is not good for solar. But I can't complain this power pack delivered and held up great.",

Viewed this item on many other sites and decided to purchase with HD because I could easily return it if needed. I've had the generator for almost a month. This generator is SO QUIET! So far I charged a lamp, I Pad and phone. There is nothing to do, it comes right out of the box ready to go. You may need to charge a little but mine arrived charged. It's compact, easy to move around and has many ports. At this point I am considering upgrading to the larger one but wanted to test this out before investing more money. I gave it four stars only because I've had it such a short time and I'm still testing it, but so far so good. Hurricane Sandy was a wake up call us. Please take a moment to look around, we have hurricanes, earthquakes, power outages etc. The times are changing make sure your family is prepared, spiritually, mentally, physically. If the grid goes down it will be nice to have power and the ability to keep in touch with your family.",

Then I can put away my 12v 8xD 2-bulb flourescent lamp. A gallon of Coleman white-gas (naptha) fuel has lasted us for 3 years of camping (about 12 campouts or 24 days/nights total - cooking and using this lantern.) This lamp gives enough light to throw a football or frisbee a decent distance (30 ft) at night. Best of all : EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE JEALOUS !!!",

They are the MOST economical lanterns (and stoves), and the BRIGHTEST lanterns and HOTTEST stoves. When I want to light up a campsite with 6 tents full of YMCA adventure guides, I pump up this lantern, light it, and hoist it 8 feet in the air. Then I can put away my 12v 8xD 2-bulb flourescent lamp. A gallon of Coleman white-gas (naptha) fuel has lasted us for 3 years of camping (about 12 campouts or 24 days/nights total - cooking and using this lantern.) This lamp gives enough light to throw a football or frisbee a decent distance (30 ft) at night. Best of all : EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE JEALOUS !!!",

It comes with a small filtered funnel to aid in filling as well as two mantles to get you started. I got this powerhouse on sale and is has been well worth it.",

I was worried about it after the 2nd day because it did not seem to charge the same as it did the 1st. We did use it heavier on this last 4 day event, Charging 2 smart phones, 1 iPad2, 1 lighthouse 250, and we ran 3 of the new Light-a-Life 350's on it for probably 1 hour making and eating dinner each night. It recharged to full the 1st night with my Nomad 20 and Nomad 7 in tandem. The 2nd day it recharged to 100% again, the third day it was better than 80% and the last day I did not bother as we had to pack up. It never dropped below 60% until the last day and we used it to beat the band. Admittedly I do want to step up to the Yeti 400 for something with more power on hand. But that's cause I am too Boy scout I want to bring something out there for 4 days and be able to not have to worry about solar if the weather is not good for solar. But I can't complain this power pack delivered and held up great.",

Viewed this item on many other sites and decided to purchase with HD because I could easily return it if needed. I've had the generator for almost a month. This generator is SO QUIET! So far I charged a lamp, I Pad and phone. There is nothing to do, it comes right out of the box ready to go. You may need to charge a little but mine arrived charged. It's compact, easy to move around and has many ports. At this point I am considering upgrading to the larger one but wanted to test this out before investing more money. I gave it four stars only because I've had it such a short time and I'm still testing it, but so far so good. Hurricane Sandy was a wake up call us. Please take a moment to look around, we have hurricanes, earthquakes, power outages etc. The times are changing make sure your family is prepared, spiritually, mentally, physically.

Long battery life, and I purchased the rechargeable battery pack as well. This is the second re-chargeable Coleman lantern I have purchased this year, and I have been VERY pleased with each purchase.",

Since it has 4 separate removable light units that can be carried or placed in different locations as needed. When you put them back onto the base nit, the lights recharge so they are ready for the next time you need them. OR you can simply use the entire lantern as a single unit. Lightweight and easy to handle, it is a very good light.",

The first set of batteries lasted for a year, the 8 d batteries in the base charge the NICADS in the four removable lanterns. When they no longer hold a charge it is telling you it is time to change the main batteries, but the lantern will continue to work for days after this! We were able to send one lantern with the boys in each tent, and recharge them the next day because you know they left the light on all night! he is now a boy scout and the lantern convinced out troop to go to LED lanterns from propane! make sure to push the grey release button removing and placing the lanterns in the main base. we now have two!

They are the MOST economical lanterns (and stoves), and the BRIGHTEST lanterns and HOTTEST stoves. When I want to light up a campsite with 6 tents full of YMCA adventure guides, I pump up this lantern, light it, and hoist it 8 feet in the air. Then I can put away my 12v 8xD 2-bulb flourescent lamp. A gallon of Coleman white-gas (naptha) fuel has lasted us for 3 years of camping (about 12 campouts or 24 days/nights total - cooking and using this lantern.) This lamp gives enough light to throw a football or frisbee a decent distance (30 ft) at night. Best of all : EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE JEALOUS !!!",

The convenience of using gas is a great plus. It makes it quick and easy. The lantern is sturdy and well built. The Coleman design has not changed a lot over time but if it aint broke, don't fix it. It comes with a small filtered funnel to aid in filling as well as two mantles to get you started. I got this powerhouse on sale and is has been well worth it.",
